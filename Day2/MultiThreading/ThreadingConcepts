Difference : multithreading and multiprocessing
	-Both helps to execute a process in short period of time.
	-If the execution takes more memory or more processing power,we can go for multiprocessing
	-Because each process has dedicated CPU and memory


Difference : Abstract class and Interface
	-Abstract class contains both abstract method and non abstract methods 
	-whereas Interface contains only abstract methods
	-Multiple Inheritence can only acheived by interface


wait() and notify():
	-when wait method is called by a thread, it stops execution until other thread calls notify()
	-wait and notify belongs to OBJECT class
	

Thread synchronization:
	-Synchronization helps to run a thread 1 at a time
	-for example: if a thread is writing a data and other thread is reading the same data at same time,
	it may cause inconsistency.
	-To access shared resourse by more thread we can go for synchronization.

Thread methods:
	-join(): current thread stops execution until the other thread compleates execution
	-sleep(millisec): sleeps the thread for specific milliseconds
	-suspend(): the thread will suspend until resume method get invoked
	-stop()
	-isAlive()
	-start()
	-run()
	-interuppt()
